#+title: Faust support for Org-Babel
#+author: Thomas Rushton

Offers support for =faust-web-component= and SVG export.

Example usage:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src faust :results html :exports both
process = +;
,#+end_src
#+end_src

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src faust :results file svg :file process.svg :exports both
process = +;
,#+end_src
#+end_src

** Note: Syntax Highlighting

For syntax highlighting etc. install =faust-mode= and/or
=faustine=. Note, however, that highlighting breaks on inserting any
/delimiter/, as identified by the following from =faust-mode.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(defconst faust-regexp-faust-delimiters (rx (any "{}()[];")))
#+end_src

This is because the =font-lock= face specified for delimiters,
formerly marked as obsolete, is, as of (approx.) Emacs 29.0, [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/107f832577123ea7ebe867cba55601d0142f546f][no longer
