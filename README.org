#+title: Faust support for Org-Babel
#+author: Thomas Rushton

Example usage:

#+begin_example
#+begin_src faust :results html :exports both
process = +;
#+end_src
#+end_example

Results support limited to HTML and =faust-web-component=.

For syntax highlighting etc. install =faust-mode= and/or
=faustine=. Note, however, that highlighting breaks on inserting any
/delimiter/, as identified by the following from =faust-mode.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(defconst faust-regexp-faust-delimiters (rx (any "{}()[];")))
#+end_src
